No CLI ?

It seems that there is no way to create a "quick test" in the portal without immediately running it.

The test immediately started running after I created it in the portal. Not expected!!


Concerns:

- Many properties returned with the value "null" -- this is strongly discouraged.
A response property should only have the value "null" if "null" has some semantic meaning that is different from the property having no value.

Response of listTestFiles:

fileType: 0 - sending a bare enum (numeric value)
